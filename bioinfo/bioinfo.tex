\chapter{The informatics of biology}
Bioinformatics is the application of computational methods to biological problems,
either by analysing large amounts of data, or by replacing experiments with computer programs.

One of the main goals of protein bioinformatics is predicting the 3D structure of a protein given only its sequence.
