\chapter{Introduction}

The present thesis is an introduction to understand the work that I have done during my PhD studies.
The text is a compilation of all the things I wish I had known when I started, and I hope it would serve as a starting point for future generations of deep learning bioinformaticians.


This thesis is divided into three parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Part \ref{part:info}] introduces machine learning, the workhorse of my work.
	\item[Part \ref{part:bio}] explains the biological and biochemical underpinnings.
	\item[Part \ref{part:work}] summarizes the content of each paper in this thesis.
\end{itemize}

Following are the papers as published in the journals.
