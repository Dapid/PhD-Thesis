\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=3, lhang=0.25,  nindent=0em, findent=2pt]{\color{Maroon}T}{he present thesis}
is an introduction to help understand the work that I have done during my PhD studies.
The guiding principle that I used to compose it are all the things I wish I had known when I started, in the hope that it would serve as a starting point for future generations of deep learning bioinformaticians.

This thesis is divided into three parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Part \color{Maroon}{I}] introduces machine learning, the workhorse of my work.
	\item[Part \color{Maroon}{II}] explains the biological and biochemical underpinnings.
	\item[Part \color{Maroon}{III}] summarizes the content of each paper in this thesis.
\end{itemize}

Following are the papers as published in the journals.

The different sections are loosely coupled, so the reader is allowed and encouraged to skim or skip the parts that they are familiar with.

I have made extensive use of margin notes to guide the reader, but leaving more than enough space for notes, comments, doodles, or theorems.
